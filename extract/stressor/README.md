### MHWs
#### Background
Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are extreme warming events that are becoming more severe, frequent, and prolonged due to climate change. MHWs are defined as extended, distinct periods of unusually high seawater temperatures (Hobday et al., 2016). Specifically, an MHW occurs when seawater temperatures at a specific location exceed the local 90th percentile based on a 30-year fixed climatology (Fig. 1).
One of the most recent and severe MHWs in the northeast Pacific was the **"Blob"** of 2014â€“2016, which led to numerous ecological disturbances, including harmful algal blooms, mass seabird mortality, and shifts in community structures within kelp forests of the California Current System.
